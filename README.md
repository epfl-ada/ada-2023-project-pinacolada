## Project Title: Representation of Arabs in Cinema Before and After September 11

### Summary
This project aims to explore the portrayal of Arab characters in film, investigating possible changes in this portrayal before and after the events of 11 September 2001. Our intention is to analyse how these characters have been portrayed and to categorise these representations as 'positive' or 'negative'. The focus will be on the ethnicity of characters, particularly those not explicitly mentioned in the script, in order to understand the underlying dynamics of representation in film.

### Research Questions
- How were Arab characters represented in films before and after 9/11?
- Did 9/11 significantly alter the portrayal of Arab characters in films?
- What are the common categories of 'positive' and 'negative' portrayal, and where do Arab characters typically fall within these categories?

### Proposed Additional Datasets and their Management
- Implementation of a query to extract ethnicity data from the Freebase database.
- Analysis of character names and ethnicities using a list of Arabic names from Wikipedia and other databases.
- Assessment of the presence and roles of Arab characters in films, focusing on those released in the US and potentially in other Western countries.
- *We will use publicly available IMDb datasets to populate our dataset with, for example, rating scores*

### Methods
- Statistical analysis to compare the frequency and nature of roles assigned to Arab characters before and after 9/11.
- Natural language processing (NLP) techniques for entity recognition to identify Arabic names and locations in film summaries.
- Examination of variations in the spelling of names and their impact on the identification of Arab characters.
- *Developping a weighting of datapoints with a "relevancy score" (ie a measure of a movie's relevancy) which will be comprised of ratings, box offcie, obtained prizes, etc...*

### Proposed Timetable and Objectives
#### Week 1: In-depth Data Analysis
- Analyse in detail the data collected to identify specific trends in the representation of Arab characters.
- Carry out a comparative analysis to distinguish changes before and after 11 September 2001.
- Begin to write the relevant sections of the final report.

#### Weeks 2-3: Development of Entity Recognition Techniques
- Improve NLP techniques for more accurate identification of Arabic names and geographical references in scenarios.
- Integrate the results of this improvement into the overall analysis.
- Update the report with new findings and methodologies.

#### Week 4: Critical Analysis and Review
- Carry out a critical analysis of the results obtained.
- Identify and discuss potential limitations and biases in the study.
- Revise the report based on feedback from team members and course assistants.

#### Week 5: Final Preparation and Submission
- Finalise the report by incorporating all comments and refining the presentation of the results.
- Prepare a succinct presentation of the project for final submission.
- Check that all README and notebook criteria are met before submission.

### Questions for Course Assistants (Optional)
- Do you have any suggestions for improving our entity recognition approach for Arabic names?
- Recommendations for effectively comparing the representation of Arab characters before and after September 11?
