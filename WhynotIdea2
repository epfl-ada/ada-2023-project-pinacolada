# Justification of the Choice of Project: Why "Deja Vu! Repetition Schemes Behind the Cinema Industry Curtains" was not Selected

## Introduction
As part of our project for the ADA course, we considered several ideas. One of them, entitled "Deja Vu! Repetition schemes behind the cinema industry curtains", focused on analysing patterns of repetition in the film industry, in particular the typecasting of actors and collaboration networks in film. Although this was an intriguing idea, we decided not to pursue it for a number of reasons.

## Reasons for Discarding the Idea

### 1. Complexity of Data and Weakness of Sources
- **Lack of Structured Character Role Data:** Our idea required a detailed set of character role data, which proved difficult to obtain.
- **Limitation in the Use of NLP:** The original idea did not include the use of natural language processing models to analyse the scenarios, which could have limited our understanding of the roles.

### 2. Measuring Repetition and Success
- **Challenge of Quantifying Typecasting and Collaboration Networks:** Determining precise metrics to evaluate typecasting or the success of collaboration networks proved complex.
- **Confounding Factor Problems:** The proposed observational study could have been affected by confounding factors, making it difficult to attribute success to specific patterns of repetition.

### 3. Feasibility and Relevance to Course Objectives
- **Alignment with Course Aims:** Our alternative idea on the representation of Arabs in film before and after 9/11 aligned better with the course aims in terms of methodology and feasibility.
- **Decision Based on Feedback:** Initial feedback on our typecasting idea suggested that the other project was more feasible and that the objectives were better defined.

## Conclusion
After a thorough evaluation, we concluded that although the idea of "Deja Vu! Repetition schemes behind the cinema industry curtains" was an interesting idea, it presented significant challenges in terms of data collection, measurement, and alignment with the course objectives. As a result, we opted for a project more focused on data analysis and feasibility, focusing on the representation of Arabs in film.
